## Work session 1: Intro to GIS

### Host
Yuchen Li

### Moderators
Carl Higgs and Irena Itova

### Goal
A general overview of GIS including its objectives

### Objectives

### Description

### Schedule: 09:00-10:30

**09:00-09:30** Presentation

**09:30-09:45** Q&A session

**09:45-09:50** break

**09:50-10:30** GIS application in JIBE

## Work session 2: Urban indicators using open data

Host: Carl Higgs
Moderator:
Goal: Calculate and generate documented data and a report on a walkability index using open data

### Objectives
- Configure/plan the project
  - Identify an urban area(s) of interest
  - Identify and retrieve relevant open data sources
  - Consider the validity of these data sources, understanding their limitations/assumptions
- Calculate urban indicators
  - Construct indicators of population density, street connectivity and mixed access to services and amenities for sample points generated along the pedestrian network
- Construct and report on a walkability index 
  - Aggregate sample points for grid and overall urban region estimates
  - Export data w/ metadata, map(s), and report, which may be uploaded to open data repositories and/or submited with a publication
  - Understand the strengths and limitations of this walkability index

### Description
This session will outline an open science analysis workflow using integrated project planning to generate documented data and a report on walkability for XX, while critically engaging with the strengths and limitations of the approach.

### Schedule: 11:00-12:30

**11:00-11:30** Integrated project planning for open science

**11:30-12:00** Calculating urban indicators using open data

**12:00-12:30** Evaluating and reporting on walkability     

## Work session 3: Building a routable network model for XX

### Host
Irena Itova

### Goal
Attaching pedestrian crossings facilities to the routable network

### Objectives
### Description
### Schedule: 13:30-15:00

## Work session 4: TBC
### Goal
(*preliminary idea*) Adding additional link-attributes and routing few postcode pairs (depending on the content and tool used in the MATSim session-- I'll talk to Corin)

### Objectives

### Description
Next to the pedestrian crossing facilities and types of signalised protection, in this session we will add few
attributes (UK Open Data) to the routable  network such as Streetlights, Entrance points to Public Green Space, Public Buildings...
Then we will produce the most attractive walking route between selected origin-destination postcode pairs.
